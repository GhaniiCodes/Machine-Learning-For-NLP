# Machine Learning For NLP

Welcome to the Machine Learning for NLP repository!
This project explores the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), covering key concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations. It is designed for anyone interested in understanding how ML techniques power real-world language applications like chatbots, translators, sentiment analysis tools, and more.

## What's Inside

- 📚 Theoretical explanations of important ML and NLP concepts

- 🛠️ Implementation of foundational models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) for NLP tasks

- ✨ Preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, vectorization)

- 🧠 Machine Learning pipelines for NLP projects

- 📈 Performance evaluation and model tuning

- 🔥 Advanced topics (optional): embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), sequence models
